# React-Router and the News API

This app follows the following lab (an example of a lesson I helped create, edit, and deliver to software engineering students).

In order to run the app, run `npm i` to install all dependencies. Make sure to follow the steps for getting an API key and putting that key in a `.env` file. Run `npm run start`.

#### React, React-Router, and the News, together at last!



## Getting Started with React:
- Fork and Clone this repo then `cd` into the repo name.
- Run `create-react-app news-app` and `cd` into the `news-app`.
- Make sure that your react app has `react router` installed.
- Run `npm start`.
- Remove or delete the pre-loaded `create-react-app` stuff that comes with it (`logo.svg, app.test.js, serviceWorker`, the code in `App.css`). 

## React-Router:
- We're building this app first with the provided data in [`/data/article-data.json`](/data/article-data.json).
- Using _the provided data_, create: 
  - a navigation menu
  - a page that renders all "top news" articles
  - a page that renders all "cicadas" articles
- Create at least **4 components** (including the above components) to use for your app.
- Use **react router** to switch between looking at _top headlines_ and _at least one other category_ of news articles.


## Adding the API:
- Go to the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), create an account and sign up for an API key, it should be autogenerated.
- For this assignment, we want you to use the [Everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) and top headlines [Top Headlines](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) endpoints. Take a look through the docs to read through the data response object and request parameters(what is required?). Then, plan out what data you want to use in your app. (ex. Title and Description seem like a good start).
- **Make sure you are able to see your data before you do this step!** Create a `.env` file in the `news-app` directory. `REACT_APP_API_KEY` would be a good variable name to assign to your API key!  
- Restart your server!
- Put the `.env` file and your `node_modules` (this might already be there) in a `.gitignore` file.
- Now replace the provided data you used above with data returned from your API calls. 

**Styling is required for this assignment.** You may style your App in `App.css`.


## Deliverables
- A **styled**, News App that has at least 4 components and makes a GET request to the News API!

## Tips:

- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) and [basic example](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic)



## Bonus
- Create an input field that allows you to query for different topics. Hmmm, I wonder how many articles there are about cicadas???
- A button that filters out articles by news source.  (i.e., a button that returns all the news from The New York Times)
- Use [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to format the `publishedAt` date. Hmmm, what format is it in right now?  
- Use a component library to style your app! [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Ant-Design](https://ant.design/) (These are just examples, there are many others).  


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
