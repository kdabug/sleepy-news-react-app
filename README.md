# React and the News API

#### React and the News, together at last!
- This assignment is meant to reinforce what we have already learned and for you get into a good workflow as we approach Project 2. We want you to flex your creative muscles by building out a simple app.

## Getting Started:
- Fork and Clone this repo then `cd` into the repo name.
- Run `create-react-app news-app` and `cd` into the `news-app`.
- Install axios.
- Run `npm start`.
- Remove or delete the pre-loaded `create-react-app` stuff that comes with it (`logo.svg, app.test.js, serviceWorker`, the code in `App.css`). _This step is mandatory_.
- Go to the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), create an account and sign up for an API key, it should be autogenerated.
- For this assignment, we want you to use the [Everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) endpoint. Take a look through the docs to read through the data response object and request parameters(what is required?). Then, plan out what data you want to use in your app. Title and Description, seems like a good start.
- **Make sure you are able to see your data before you do this step!** Create a `.env` file in the `news-app` directory. `REACT_APP_API_KEY` would be a good variable name to assign to your API key!  
- Restart your server!
- Put the `.env` file and your `node_modules` (this might already be there) in a `.gitignore` file.
- Once you can see your data, create **4 components** to use for your app.
    - What else in the data can you use as a component? 
- Styling is **required** for this assignment. You may style your App in `App.css`


## Deliverables
- A **styled**, News App that has at least 4 components and makes a GET request to the News API!
- A pull request by 11pm tonight.
- Comfort and Completion levels.

## Bonus
- Create an input field that allows you to query for different topics. Hmmm, I wonder how many articles there are about bananas????
- A button that filters out articles by news source.  (i.e., a button that returns all the news from The New York Times)
- Create a navbar component and implement [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) to route to your other components.
- Use [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) to format the `publishedAt` date. Hmmm, what format is it in right now?  
- Use a component library to style your app! [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or [Ant-Design](https://ant.design/) (These are just examples, there are many others).
